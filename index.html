    <h2> The Stars
    </h2>
    <body>
    <p> The stars are higher than the sky <br>
    The earth is lower than the sky<br>
    So the earth compared to the stars <br> 
    Is unreachable<br>
    You can't reach the stars from where we are<br>
    It's impossible<br>
    They always say it doesn't hurt to try<br>
    But if it's impossible<br>
    How can we do the impossible<br>
    Just to reach the stars<br>
